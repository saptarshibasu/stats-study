# Basics of Statistics

## Measures of Central Tendency

### Mean

* Disadvantage - Easily affected by outliers

### Median

The middle number in an ordered dataset

* Advantage - Not affected by extreme observations unlike mean

### Mode

* The value that occurs most often (The value with the highest frequency)
* A dataset can have multiple or no modes

## Skewness

### Right Skew (Positive Skew)

* Mean > Median
* The tail is leading to the right
* The outliers are to the right

### Symmetrical

mean = median = mode

### Left Skew (Negative Skew)

* Mean < Median
* The tail is leading to the right
* The outliers are to the right

## Variance

The dispersion of the data points around the mean value
