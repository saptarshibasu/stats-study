# Basics of Statistics

## Measures of Central Tendency

### Mean

* Disadvantage - Easily affected by outliers

$$
\begin{align*}
Population \, Mean &= \mu &= \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{x_{i}}{N} \\
Sample \, Mean &= \,\mathrel{\bar{x}} &= \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_{i}}{n}
\end{align*}
$$

### Median

The middle number in an ordered dataset

* Advantage - Not affected by extreme observations unlike mean

### Mode

* The value that occurs most often (The value with the highest frequency)
* A dataset can have multiple or no modes

## Skewness

### Right Skew (Positive Skew)

* Mean > Median
* The tail is leading to the right
* The outliers are to the right

### Symmetrical

mean = median = mode

### Left Skew (Negative Skew)

* Mean < Median
* The tail is leading to the right
* The outliers are to the right

## Variance

The dispersion of the data points around the mean value

$$
\begin{align*}
Population \, Variance &= \sigma^2 &= \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\(x_{i} - \mu\)^2}{N} \\
Sample \, Variance &= \, S^2 &= \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\(x_{i} - \mathrel{\bar{x}}\)}{n - 1}
\end{align*}
